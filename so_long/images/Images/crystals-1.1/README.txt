Notes:
  - The Purple Amethyst is so heavily edited that I no longer consider
    my work a "derivative".
  - IMPORTANT:
    - I have re-released these under CC0. They were previously under
      OGA BY 3.0 / CC BY 3.0.
    - It is not required to attribute the authors, but their names
      are listed in the attribution section for reference for anyone
      that would like to credit them.
